## 🎯 Objective

The main goals of this project are to:

- Explore relationships between demographic / health attributes and insurance charges  
- Visualize trends and correlations  
- Build regression models to predict insurance costs  
- Evaluate model performance and interpret key factors

## 🧠 Key Features / Components

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with charts and plots  
- Feature engineering (if any)  
- Regression modeling (linear regression, regularization, etc.)  
- Model evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²)  
- Interpretations and insights from the models
